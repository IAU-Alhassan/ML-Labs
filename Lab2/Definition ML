Q1- The ML consider Classification
Q2- yes there is a target value (column name: class)
    1 = spam email
    0 = non-spam email
Q3- The model predicts weather the email spam or not:
    1- the words pattern ( free, money, ....)
    2- the symbol appear ( #, $ ,!, .....)
The problem:
The goal is for the model to learn patterns from the training emails so it can correctly predict whether previously unseen emails are spam or not
— helping email services filter junk mail effectively.
